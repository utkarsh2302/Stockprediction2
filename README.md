Stock Prediction Project

Overview

This project involves building a stock prediction model to forecast stock prices using historical data. The model leverages machine learning techniques to analyze patterns and trends in stock prices, enabling better investment decisions.

Features

Predict future stock prices based on historical data.

Visualize stock price trends and predictions using plots.

Evaluate model performance with error metrics such as RMSE and MAE.

Technologies Used

Python

Libraries:

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd stock-prediction

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Stock prediction.ipynb

Usage

Load the dataset and explore its structure.

Preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, normalization).

Train the model using different algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, LSTM).

Visualize the predicted vs. actual stock prices.

Results

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Future Enhancements

Implement deep learning models like LSTM and GRU.

Include sentiment analysis from financial news to improve predictions.

Optimize hyperparameters using grid search or other techniques.
